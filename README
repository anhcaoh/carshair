# Carshair #

## Get started ##

1. run `yarn install` to download dependencies
2. navigate to subfolder `/ios` and run `pod install`, then `cd ..` to go back to the app's root
3. run `yarn ios` to start the app locally via iOS simulator

## Assumptions ##

- Assuming using the random image API https://picsum.photos/ to render the displayed cars yet the images will be random
- Assuming 'Book now' feature is not in scope
- Assuming developers (whom running this repo) have the sufficient software development requirements installed locally to run react native apps on iOS simulator (i.e. xCode, Ruby, CocoaPods, Node, react-native-cli)

## Screenshots ##

- See /public/screenshots for locally running Carshair app
